# TASK 01: IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION:

The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers namely:
 

1.   Iris-versicolor
2.   Iris-Setosa
3.   Iris-Virginica

And each class contains 4 features, **'Sepal length', 'Sepal width', 'Petal length', 'Petal width'**. 

The **aim of the iris flower classification** is **to predict flowers based on their specific features.**

**PROCEDURE:**

STEP 1: Load the necessary libraries

STEP 2: Import the Data set

STEP 3: Analyze and visualize the dataset

STEP 4: Model Training

STEP 5: Model Evaluation

STEP 6: Model Testing

STEP 7: Predicting the result

STEP 8: Estimating the accuracy of the model for different algorithm.

# TASK_02: Email_Spam_Classification_Using Python and ML:



Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors
such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.
Linear regression model to predict Sales using an appropriate predictor variable.

A product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict
their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their
product. So let's start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.

# TASK_03: Sales_Prediction_Using_PYTHON_ML:



Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors
such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.



Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict
their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their
product. so this task will accomplish the above said requirement using python machine learning techniques.
